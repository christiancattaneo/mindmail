# Debugging Guide - Blank View & Hang Issues

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Logging Added**

I've added logging throughout the journal entry flow to trace the issues you're experiencing.

## 📊 **Log Flow - What to Watch For**

### **When You Tap a Calendar Date:**

#### **Expected Log Sequence:**
```
🗓️ [CalendarView] Date tapped: 2025-10-24
📝 [CalendarView] Entry exists: false
✅ [CalendarView] Calling onDateSelected with date: 2025-10-24, entry: false
📲 [MainTabView] Date selected: 2025-10-24, hasEntry: false
📲 [MainTabView] State updated - showing sheet
🎬 [MainTabView] Sheet appeared - selectedDate: Optional(2025-10-24)
🎨 [JournalEntryFlowView] INIT called for date: 2025-10-24
💾 [JournalEntryViewModel] Loading existing entry for date: 2025-10-24
💾 [JournalEntryViewModel] No existing entry found - starting fresh
🎨 [JournalEntryFlowView] INIT complete
👀 [JournalEntryFlowView] View appeared - currentStep: mood
```

#### **If You See This Instead (PROBLEM):**
```
📲 [MainTabView] Date selected: ...
🎬 [MainTabView] Sheet appeared - selectedDate: nil  ← PROBLEM!
❌ [MainTabView] ERROR: selectedDate is nil!
```

---

### **When You Select a Mood:**

#### **Expected:**
```
😊 [MoodSelectionView] Mood selected: Awesome
😊 [MoodSelectionView] selectedMood updated to: Optional(awesome)
```

---

### **When You Tap "Next" Button:**

#### **Expected:**
```
➡️ [JournalEntryFlowView] handleNext - current step: mood
➡️ [JournalEntryFlowView] Moving to next step...
🚶 [JournalEntryViewModel] moveToNextStep called - current: 1
🚶 [JournalEntryViewModel] Moving to step: 2
✅ [JournalEntryViewModel] Now at step: 2
➡️ [JournalEntryFlowView] New step: struggle
🔄 [JournalEntryFlowView] Step changed from mood to struggle
```

#### **If There's a Hang, You'll See:**
```
➡️ [JournalEntryFlowView] handleNext - current step: mood
➡️ [JournalEntryFlowView] Moving to next step...
🚶 [JournalEntryViewModel] moveToNextStep called - current: 1
... [3 second delay here] ...
🚶 [JournalEntryViewModel] Moving to step: 2
```

The delay between lines shows where the hang occurs!

## 🐛 **Suspected Issues & What Logs Will Reveal**

### **Issue #1: Blank View on First Tap**

**Hypothesis A:** Sheet Content Created Before State Update
```
Expected: selectedDate set → sheet appears → content created
Actual:   sheet appears → content created → selectedDate set (too late!)

Look for: Sheet appeared before "State updated"
```

**Hypothesis B:** View Model Init Blocks Rendering
```
Expected: Init fast → view renders → shows content
Actual:   Init slow → view waits → blank screen → then renders

Look for: Long delay between INIT and "View appeared"
```

**Hypothesis C:** Async Load Race Condition
```
Expected: Init → render → async load → update UI
Actual:   Init → async load blocks → blank → then shows

Look for: "Loading existing entry" takes too long
```

---

### **Issue #2: Hang After Emoji Selection**

**Hypothesis A:** Auto-Focus Delay
```
Expected: Emoji selected → next step → auto-focus text field (300ms)
Actual:   Emoji selected → [HANG] → next step

Look for: Delay between "Mood selected" and "Moving to next step"
```

**Hypothesis B:** Animation Conflict
```
Expected: Mood animation completes → step transition
Actual:   Mood animation + step animation conflict → hang

Look for: Multiple animations firing simultaneously
```

**Hypothesis C:** Text Editor Initialization
```
Expected: TextEditor appears instantly
Actual:   TextEditor initialization slow (iOS bug)

Look for: Delay between "Now at step: 2" and view appearing
```

## 🔧 **How to Use These Logs**

### **Step 1: Launch App Fresh**
```
1. Quit and relaunch app in simulator
2. Go to calendar
3. Tap a date
4. Watch Xcode console
```

### **Step 2: Record First Tap Log Sequence**
```
Note:
- Time between "Date selected" and "Sheet appeared"
- Time between "INIT" and "View appeared"  
- Whether "selectedDate: nil" appears
- Any gaps in log sequence
```

### **Step 3: Dismiss and Retry**
```
1. Close the blank view
2. Tap same date again
3. Compare log sequence
4. Note differences
```

### **Step 4: Test Emoji → Next Hang**
```
1. Tap emoji
2. Note timestamp
3. Tap "Next"
4. Note when next screen appears
5. Calculate delay from logs
```

## 🎯 **Potential Fixes Based on Logs**

### **If "selectedDate: nil" Appears:**
**Problem:** Race condition in state update  
**Fix:** Force synchronous state update before sheet

### **If Long Delay in INIT:**
**Problem:** Blocking initialization  
**Fix:** Defer more work to background

### **If Delay After "Moving to step 2":**
**Problem:** TextEditor initialization slow  
**Fix:** Pre-render text editors or use different component

### **If Multiple Animations Overlap:**
**Problem:** Animation conflicts  
**Fix:** Sequence animations or reduce complexity
