- ⏸️ Notification handling when tapped (requires app delegate setup)
- ⏸️ Tests for letter scheduling
- ⏸️ Integration tests for complete user journeys

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Security-First Design
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before storage
- **Sanitization**: Control characters removed, HTML stripped
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 100 scheduled letters enforced
- **Loop Prevention**: Minimum 1-minute scheduling delay
- **Data Integrity**: All models use strict validation
- **Fail Secure**: Defaults to deny, explicit allow

### Design System
- **Colors**: Soft pastels (lavender, peach, sky blue, rose) per aesthetic.md
- **Typography**: SF Pro with consistent sizing and weights
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/8/12/16/20/24/32/40/48pt scale
- **Corner Radius**: 8/12/16/20/24/30pt for different components
- **Shadows**: Subtle, medium, strong variations
- **Animations**: Spring animations for natural feel
- **Haptics**: Medium impact for actions, light for navigation

## 🔒 Security Features

### Built-In Protections
1. **Input Validation**: All text validated before processing
2. **Length Limits**: 50 chars (name), 140 chars (journal), 100/2000 (letters)
3. **Character Restrictions**: Letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only for names
4. **Sanitization**: Removes control characters, prevents XSS
5. **Max Limits**: 100 scheduled letters maximum
6. **Time Validation**: Letters must be 1+ minutes in future
7. **No Self-Triggering**: Notifications are one-way only
8. **Local-Only**: All data stored locally, no cloud sync

### OWASP Compliance
- ✅ Input validation on all user data
- ✅ Output encoding (sanitization)
- ✅ Least privilege (local storage only)
- ✅ Defense in depth (validation at model + view layers)
- ✅ Fail secure (validation errors block save)
- ✅ Secure error messages (no system info leaked)
